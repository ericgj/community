A community based site for [Mendicant University](http://mendicantuniversity.org). For more information about the site, check out its
[about page](http://community.mendicantuniversity.org/about).

## Installation

Community is a Ruby on Rails 3.1 application which runs on Ruby 1.9.2+ and
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) databases. Other databases like MySQL
or SQLite are not officially supported.

### Setting Up a Development Copy: Step by Step

To install a development version of Community, follow these steps:

1. Fork our GitHub repository: <http://github.com/mendicant-university/community>
2. Clone the fork to your computer
3. If you don't already have bundler installed, get it by running `gem install bundler`
4. Run `bundle install` to install all of the project's dependencies
5. Run `bundle exec rake setup` to create the required config files
6. Edit `config/database.yml`, and make sure your database server is running
7. Finally, run `bundle exec rake setup` again to create the database, and seed it with data

To make things even easier, you can copy and paste this into your terminal once you've got the project cloned to your computer

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec rake setup
```
